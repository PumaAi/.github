[Puma Ai Network](https://puma.network/) is a decentralized infrastructure layer built of top of ~1m mobile phones running [Puma Browser](https://www.pumabrowser.com/).

Our goal is to create Open LLMs (Large Language Models) with much more transparency over how to run and train them.

More info coming soon.
